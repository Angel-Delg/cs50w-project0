        <h2 class="text-info m-5">Development of the tourism sector in Morocco 1995 to 2020</h2>
        <p>The following table shows the number of foreign tourists registered in Morocco per year. A tourist is any person who spends at least one night in the country but does not live there for more than 12 months. To the extent that the survey also included the purpose of the trip, business and other non-tourism trips had already been filtered out. In most countries, the number of passengers passing through on the same day, for example ship crews or aircraft crews, is also not considered a tourism target. If the same person comes and goes several times a year, each visit counts again.</p>
        <p>Data in the table in millions of tourists. The red line corresponds to the average of all 6 countries in North Africa.</p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="images/grafico.png" alt="table">

        <p>Morocco registered a total of 3 million tourists in 2020, ranking 53rd in the world in absolute terms.</p>
        <p>Not including the size of a country, such a ranking list may not be very meaningful. Putting the tourist numbers in relation to the population of Morocco, the result is a much more comparable picture: With 0.075 tourists per resident, Morocco ranks 131st in the world. In North Africa it ranked 4th. Morocco generated around 4.51 billion US dollars in the tourism sector alone. This corresponds to 3.4 percent of its gross domestic product and about 43 percent of all international tourism receipts in North Africa.</p>
